## My process

Having failed the first time I tried this, I came back now after more than 6 months and I'm quite pleased with the result. I have specifically NOT made the design responsive, as I wanted to make the page more static this time, and take on more challenging projects as I go forward.

### Built with

- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Being mindful of flex containers and how to position items inside of them, using the :child-selector with different margins to accomplish the offset design of the cards in the desktop version.

### Continued development

Continue buidling responsive website, integrating my JS skills, continue to make things faster.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://www.css-tricks.com) - This helped me with a lot of the CSS-styling and getting the responsiveness to the grid.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - This resource was also of great help to figure out the grid layout and the @media additions to the code.
