## My process
I started building the site with desktop in mind first. Found that to be frustrating when designing for mobile, and discarded all my css and started again with mobile-first. This went a lot better, but there are still a few minor issues with the design that I just can't nail down at this point in time.

### Built with

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to use CSS grid, and specifically grid areas in a way that I was not used to before. Had to think hard about how to get the responsive design right, and it's about 98% there now. The last 2% is going to take too long for now, have to keep moving to a new project to learn at a more suitable pace.

### Continued development

I need top be able to place elements individually with more precision. Not yet at the point where I can place the ratings offset from each other. That's something I need to learn.
Additionally, the time this took was way too long if I was working on a real project, and experiences like this should make me faster when I move forward.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://www.css-tricks.com) - This helped me with a lot of the CSS-styling and getting the responsiveness to the grid.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - This resource was also of great help to figure out the grid layout and the @media additions to the code.
